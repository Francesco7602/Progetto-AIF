# Progetto-AIF
il gruppo si registra qui (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEKDQYEJURKyvjWXDiVB9YeO5ZSNP7PL_QWUauk4nCCMsh-Q/viewform)

Self-contained project (I should be able to download and run it
easily
Only open-source tools and software allowed
The project MUST contain methodologies studied during
the course ->
the more, the better.
• It needs to contain a demostrator / empirical evaluation
Make it small: high complexity is not demanded.
• Re-use: you can use all available assets you want: libraries,
other exams project pieces, scripts in the internet, etc. but
make sure to mention it in the report.

The notebook report is key for evaluation:
• The evaluation will be based on this + github repo (put
the link inside!) + presentation
• Attention to details is key, length is not (make it 5 pages
max), it should contain both descriptions and runnable
code on Google Colab
• The report should contain
•
Introduction, related works, methodologies, assessment,
conclusion
• Appendix: team contributions, github metrics,
relationship with the course
Once you have completed the project
• The team ref. can submit it via email to
vincenzo.lomonaco@unipi.it
• 1 files: the computational
notebook exported in pdf
• Use the subject “[AIF Project Submission] – X Team”
• Once approved it will be
valid 1 year and you’ll get access to
the oral exam in the ordinary exam sessions.
• Orals
• The oral session will be based on the teacher questions about
the project + ordinary course questions
• Top-3 projects
• will receive a public acknowledgement on the course website,
can be continued as Master dissertations or scientific publication
